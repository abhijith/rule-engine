Request attributes
-------------------
:name, :category, :preferences, :country, :language


Advert attributes
-----------------
:name, :start-date, :end-date, :category, :country, :language

Design:
-------
* Rule
 - Operands
 - Operators

* Rule Evaluator
  * bind request to rule
  * bind ad to rule
  * evaluate / interpret
  * returns true | false

* All Ads which eval to true are picked

* Update counters and other book keeping information / metrics


Example:
--------

(:request-language is-member :ad-language)
AND
(:request-category equal-to :ad-category)
OR
(:request-category is-a :ad-category)

Operands:
	request-category, :ad-category, :request-language, :ad-language

Operators or functions:
	is-member, equal-to, is-a

Dispatch: (apply operator-fn request-attrs ad-attrs)

# Example 1
# ---------
# A request comes with the following info:

# Channel has category "cars";
# User has preferences "cars","gadgets"

# We have the following ads available:
# Ad 1 -- category "cars"
# Ad 2 -- Category "gadgets"

# Returning Ad 1 is a better match since it doesn't contradict the channel's category

# Example 2
# ---------
# Channel has category "cars"
# User has preferences "gadgets"

# Perhaps we don't return any ad since:

# Ad 1 goes against the user's preferences
# Ad 2 is not related to the channel


# From here you can see that this starting point still allows you to
# move on to more complex situations:

# Categories can have hierarchies (gadgets can be phones, tablets,
# watches). If there is a preference on a subcategory, that can imply a
# preference on a parent category.

# In my example 2, one could argue that it's less bad not to respect the
# channel's category than the user's preference. So, if we can give the
# user an ad they are interested on, even if that's not in the category
# space of the channel, maybe that's a good alternative.

# We have the following ads available:
# Ad 1 -- category "cars"
# Ad 2 -- Category "gadgets"

# Perhaps we don't return any ad since:
# Ad 1 goes against the user's preferences
# Ad 2 is not related to the channel
